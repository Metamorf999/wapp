# React Weather App

This repository contains a React-based web application designed to provide weather reports for various countries. Leveraging APIs, promises, and the Axios library, this project offers a seamless and responsive user experience for accessing up-to-date weather information.

## Key Features

- **Country Selection**: Users can easily select a country from the provided list or search for a specific country using the search functionality.
  
- **Real-Time Weather Data**: The application fetches real-time weather data from external APIs, ensuring accuracy and reliability in weather reports.
  
- **Responsive Design**: The user interface is built with responsiveness in mind, ensuring optimal display on devices of all sizes.
  
- **Asynchronous Operations**: Asynchronous JavaScript operations using promises and the Axios library allow for efficient fetching of weather data without blocking the main execution thread.
  
## Technologies Used

- **React**: The frontend is built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, enabling efficient component-based development and state management.
  
- **Axios**: Axios is utilized for making HTTP requests to fetch weather data from external APIs, providing a simple and intuitive interface for handling asynchronous operations.
  
- **API Integration**: The application integrates with external weather APIs to retrieve accurate and up-to-date weather information for selected countries.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
